The data I used is Cyclisticâ€™s Historical Trip Data to analyze and identify trends.

The previous 12 months data from 2021 March to 2022 Feb is used for analysis.

The data is stored in CSV files. Each file contains one month data. Thus a total of 12 .csv files.

The data is structured data ie., Organised data.

The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate.**
